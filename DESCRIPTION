Description: An implimentation of estimators for partially identified 
    parameters as described in Manski The Partial Identification 
    of Probability Distributions. This package provides a syntax
    for identifying the bounds on parameters whose value cannot
    be determined but merely constrained. It computes lower and upper 
    bounds on parameters using either non-parameteric regression, 
    series estimators, or linear models, and confidence intervals
    for the location of the parameter given the upper and lower 
    bounds. It can be used to estimate conditional means with 
    missing data, or treatment effects with selection into 
    treatment.
